    item = Assault Vest
    ability = Quark Drive
    evs = Hardcore
    nature = Adamant
    moves = Close Combat, Plasma Fists, Earthquake, Ice Punch / Drain Punch
    comment = Due to its high attack and great bulk when combined with an Assault Vest, Iron Hands is able to defeat the majority of the Elite 4 1v1, and acts as a check to most of it. This is made possible by the combination of Close Combat, Plasma Fists, Earthquake, and Ice Punch. Only Lance's Arceus-Fairy and Lance's Necrozma-DM are able to sit infront of Hands.

Optionally, you could go Drain Punch over Ice Punch to regain some health, but this leaves you vulnerable to the likes of Mega Rayquaza, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. You can use Iron Hands to pick up a few extra kills if you have a strategy to deal with those three.

    evs = Hardcore
    nature = Modest
    moves = Moonblast, Shadow Ball, Mystical Fire, Thunder
    comment = Due to its excellent coverage, speed, and high special attack, Flutter Mane can deal amazing damage to every Pokemon in the Elite 4, particularly 2HKOing the majority.

When equipped with an Assault Vest, Flutter Mane can effectively defend it's self from some of the Elite 4's most powerful special attackers. Most notably, being able to sit in front of Blue's Xerneas, Eternatus, and Walking Wake, Agatha's Yveltal, Lance's Arceus-Fairy, and Lorelei's Tapu Fini and Kyurem White.

Iron Bundle, Tapu Fini, and Primal Kyogre can all be quickly handled with Thunder as your fourth move while you don't have to worry about missing in rain.

Lickylicky
{
Name- test
Item - Assault Vest, Focus Sash, Choice Band , Normal Gem
Ability - Cloud Nine
EVs - no EVs since hardcore
Moves - Explosion , Power whip, Bulldoze, Dragon tail, Knock off

Comment- Lickylicky is an excellent Pokemon for Hardcore E4 especially if u can't or don't wanna use golduck. This thing even walls eternamax eternatus and use explosion to safely chip things, it has bulldoze for speed lowering , knock off for utilities and along side a good mon completely destroys hail Lorelei. Mega lucario completely destroys hail Lorelei with this thing alongside it. It can also use multiple items such as focus sash assault vest for more bulk or even just leftovers, And if u think this thing is ugly atleast it's better than slaking and regigigas
